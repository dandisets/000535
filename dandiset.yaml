description: "This study investigates the effects of periodic sensory stimulation
  (PSS) on the activity of neurons of different types in the mouse visual cortex.
  The PSS modality used is the flickering light visual stimulation. The dataset provides
  calcium imaging data from VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide), SST (somatostatin),
  and PV (parvalbumin) expressing inhibitory neuron, as well as excitatory neurons
  in V1, in mice exposed to different visual stimulation conditions.\n \nThe visual
  stimulus is provided by an LED strip that is programmed for 4 conditions: 40 Hz
  flicker (gamma frequency), 8 Hz flicker (theta frequency), random frequency (light
  delivered with a random interval determined by a Poisson process with an average
  frequency of 40 Hz), and constant light on. Those conditions are reported in NWB
  file trial table. The LED strip was positioned in front of the mouse right eye in
  place of the visual stimulation screen used in (De Vries, Lecoq, Buice et al, Nature
  Neuroscience 2020). Light illumination started approximately 485 seconds into the
  experiment. The exact timing can be found in the stimulus table. Each mouse was
  recorded multiple times with individual cells matched. Each recording session only
  used one of the above stimulus conditions.\n \nThe data includes images from layers
  2/3 and 5 (layer 4 instead of 5 for VIP) of the left visual cortex, capturing the
  contributions of superficial and deep cortical neurons to the network dynamics under
  visual PSS. The dataset was collected from 5 mice for SST, 6 mice for VIP, 2 mice
  for PV, and 2 mice for excitatory neurons. Mice were awake but not trained to perform
  any tasks. They were passively viewing the LED strip.  All animal procedures were
  approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Allen
  Institute for Brain Science in compliance with NIH guidelines."
